# Ep004: Understanding and Working with Mixins in Python

This repository contains code examples that accompany the "Listen and Learn Code" podcast Ep004: Understanding and Working with Mixins in Python.

## Examples

1. **Inheritance Example** (`01_inheritance_example.py`)

   - Demonstrates basic inheritance in Python, showcasing how subclasses can inherit and override methods from a parent class.

2. **Composition Example** (`02_composition_example.py`)

   - Illustrates how composition allows for building complex objects from simpler ones by including instances of other classes as attributes.

3. **Basic Mixin Example** (`03_basic_mixin_example.py`)

   - Shows how to use a mixin to add specific functionality to a class, demonstrating the benefits of mixins in avoiding deep inheritance hierarchies.

4. **Mixin vs. Inheritance** (`04_mixin_vs_inheritance.py`)

   - Compares and contrasts regular inheritance with mixins, explaining when and why to use each approach.

5. **Advanced Mixin with Method Resolution Order (MRO)** (`05_advanced_mixin_mro_example.py`)
   - Explains how Python resolves methods when multiple mixins are involved, with a focus on understanding the Method Resolution Order (MRO).
